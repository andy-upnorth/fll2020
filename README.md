# fll2020
FLL 2020 repo

This is our shared learning area for FLL 2020

Feel to create new sample directories. 
Eventually we will create the working project(s) here as well

There are instructions for opening projects here:
  https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/startrun.html#opening-an-existing-project

Use the "Open Folder..." option in VS Code on one of the subdirectories of this project, such as `sample1` or `robot_educator_line` ...  
Don't use the "Open Workspace" option because it ends up getting confused when launching into the debugger.
