TODO:
* Consider adding an initial series of beeps to indicate mission (1 beep for mission 1, etc...)
* Several more seconds can be trimmed by increasing speeds in untuned sections.
* Remaining unreliable portions:
  * When exiting the step counter it will sometimes get confused after refinding the line
    on its way to the treadmill. We're doing a 3 point turn to drop the robot right on the line
    but it still happens. I suspect it's because we're setting the stall limit on the treadmill
    motor to a hair trigger, which is actually triggering a stall when we start spinning it.
    This problem appears to happen most during low battery charge. We tried changing it
  * The weight machine worked perfectly for a while during the middle of our sessions but we
    didn't do anything to change the logic. We only saw it working when the weight machine was
    set to "yellow". It was close enough I think it could be made pretty reliable.
  * Pullup mission (#3) sometimes executes when trying to run basketball mission (#2) because
    the gyro is detected as being unplugged even when it's plugged in. Replugging helps.
  * The final left turn in mission 3 toward the pullup bar sometimes drops the line. It only
    seems to happen when the battery is low, and might benefit from a slightly bigger "back
    up to find the line" step. (comment "back up and make final left turn to find new line")
